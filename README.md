AI evaluates lifestyle based on income, nutrition, and overall health, indicating a person's quality of life. This analysis is powered by machine learning and trained on a custom-generated dataset of over 1000 entries, created specifically to reflect diverse lifestyle patterns. 

The system features an AI-powered chatbot built using Chatbase, trained on a personalized knowledge.txt file containing curated insights on health, wellness, and finance. This allows the chatbot to engage with users effectivelyâ€”answering questions and providing personalized suggestions, such as healthier eating habits, exercise plans, or tips to improve financial stability. By combining intelligent analysis with conversational AI, the project delivers tailored lifestyle recommendations in real-time.

Health and Wealth Correlation: It emphasizes the connection between good health and financial stability in improving one's overall quality of life.
Personalized Guidance: Through the chatbot, users can receive real-time advice and support tailored to their unique lifestyle factors.
